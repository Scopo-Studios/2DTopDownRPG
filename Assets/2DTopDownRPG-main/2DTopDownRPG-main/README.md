Issues or Changes:
Part 11: 
    - Attack sprites were not available so I modified the existing character sprites for the attack animations. 
    - Sword and hitbox might be too short
    - Had to move attack code to Update()
Part 20:
    - Had to change the animation recordings for the hitboxes so the enemy won't slide from the hitbox
    - Character sprite is always under the enemy sprite
Part 21:
    - Skipped part of screen tearing fix so no screen atlas
Part 22:
    - If you hold down to move buttons while attacking an enemy, the enemy will get hit twice immediately
Part 23:
    - Renamed Signal to Signal Sender because newer Unity already has a Signal object

Notes:
Skipped Part 7 because it was just talking about a different way for tilesets
Skipped Part 26-29 because I thought they seemed irrelevant

World-building:
